I want to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Bernd Br\"ugge for making this project possible. I am especially grateful to my advisor, Juan Haladjian, for finding time and patience to discuss all the ideas that I came up with in the process of writing this thesis.

I also thank to my beloved friend Deniz Yeltekin for her support during my master study in Munich. She always encouraged me even when I lost my motivation and inspired me with her successes.

And above all, I would like to dedicate this thesis work to my parents Berrin and Hamdi Yigin. I want to thank my mother for her continual support and words of encouragement, and I want to thank my father for being my inspiration to pursue this field of work and education. I thank to dear my sister Merve Yigin for supporting me. They always believed in me even when I failed. They made a big effort for raising me as a fair and conscientious person.
